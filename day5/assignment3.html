	<p>During last year's very first lockdown it was at least looking more light outside. In March and April, Winter turned into spring, the sun was out a lot, taking walks was easy, everyone was renovating their balconies and terraces and backyards to spend time there
	</p>
	<p> But now we are still in the middle of the dark season here in Germany. Every day it's just rainy and cold and wet outside. Every year people get depressed around this time of year. It’s the winter blues…
	</p>
<section>
	<p> But without the option of having your friends over to sit around your little backyard bonfire sipping on mulled wine, hitting the nearest slopes to go skiing with the family, or simply hanging out at your favorite coffee shop every day, it’s even harder than all the years before.
	</p>
</section>
	<p>Because now we’re just home and alone. All of the time.
</p>
	</div>
	<p>Despite being a bit of a travel addict and usually skipping the dark season altogether by spending my time traveling to someplace more warm and tropical, I am pretty good at being alone.

	<p>‘You have to start romanticizing your life, you have to start thinking of yourself as the main character, ‘cause if you dont life will continue to pass you by, and all the little things that make it so beautiful will continue to go unnoticed, so take a second and look around…’.
